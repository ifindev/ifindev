### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Muhammad Arifin. A graduate of engineering physics with lots of mathematics, physics, and physics simulations. That's all in the past though, right now what I am passionate about is, really, Software Engineering.

### What I'm Currently Working On ðŸ”­
Iâ€™m currently working on a firmware (software for hardware) for a local positioning system with a target accuracy of 10 cm using DW1000 Ultra Wide Band module from [Decawave](https://www.decawave.com/product/dwm1000-module/). So this is like a GPS, but in a local environment for autonomous robot navigation. 

At first I work with C++ and creating several custom arduino library for a new positioning schemes. For the codes, I integrated the [existing DW1000 library](https://github.com/F-Army) and uses all the available APIs. Now, I am mostly use C programming language to implement complex positioning and kalman filter algorithms, since it is more portable accross different microcontrollers.

### What I'm Currently Learning ðŸŒ± 
On my free time after office, I learn and work with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and also PHP. Why learning all of these? Well, because I just love programming. And I think web development is really exciting because we can create anything just with laptop, google, and ideas. Awesome!
