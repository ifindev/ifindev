### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Muhammad Arifin. A graduate of engineering physics with lots of mathematics, physics, and physics simulations. That's all in the past though, right now what I am passionate about is, really, web development especially building a Web App using ReactJs and other technologies.

### What I'm Currently Working On ðŸ”­
Iâ€™m currently working on a firmware (software for hardware) for a local positioning system with a target accuracy of 10 cm using DW1000 Ultra Wide Band module from [Decawave](https://www.decawave.com/product/dwm1000-module/). So this is like a GPS, but in a local environment for autonomous robot navigation.

### Current Side Projects ðŸŒ± 
After office, I spent my time mostly doing Web Development especially front-end development. For a small static webpage, I used HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla Javascript. But lately, I've been really hooked by ReactJs and ReactJs Hooks. It's so amazing seeing what can be build with it. That's why I'm planning to go on mastering Javascript and ReactJs for fun and a better opportunity in the future!
