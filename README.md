### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Muhammad Arifin. A graduate of engineering physics with lots of mathematics, physics, and physics simulations. That's all in the past though, right now what I am passionate about is, really, web development especially building Web Application both on the Frontend side and also on the Backend.
