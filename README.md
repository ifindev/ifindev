### Hi there 👋
I am Muhammad Arifin. A graduate of engineering physics with lots of mathematics, physics, and physics simulations. That's all in the past though, right now what I am passionate about is, really, web development especially building Web Application using NodeJs, ExpressJs, React.js, and Typescript.
