### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Muhammad Arifin. A graduate of engineering physics with lots of mathematics, physics, and physics simulations. That's all in the past though, right now what I am passionate about is, really, web development especially building a Web App using Laravel 8, Laravel Livewire, Vue Js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS and other technologies.

### What I'm Currently Working On ðŸ”­
Iâ€™m currently working on a firmware (software for hardware) for a local positioning system with a target accuracy of 10 cm using DW1000 Ultra Wide Band module from [Decawave](https://www.decawave.com/product/dwm1000-module/). So this is like a GPS, but in a local environment for autonomous robot navigation.
