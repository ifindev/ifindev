### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Muhammad Arifin. A graduate of engineering physics with lots of mathematics, physics, and physics simulations. That's all in the past though, right now what I am passionate about is, really, web development especially building a Web App using Laravel 8, Laravel Livewire, Vue Js, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS and other technologies.

### What I'm Currently Working On ðŸ”­
Iâ€™m currently working on a firmware (software for hardware) for a local positioning system with a target accuracy of 10 cm using DW1000 Ultra Wide Band module from [Decawave](https://www.decawave.com/product/dwm1000-module/). So this is like a GPS, but in a local environment for autonomous robot navigation.

### Current Side Projects ðŸŒ± 
After office, I spent my time mostly doing Web Development. Several projects I have done on my spare time:
- React Headless Commerce: Headless eCommerce website built with React and Commerce.js 
- [Kulineran](https://github.com/ifindev/kulineran-app): A minimalist and responsive food ordering application built using Vue and Bootstrap with a Fake JSON REST API.
- [Sensor Streaming System](https://github.com/ifindev/sensor-streaming): An integrated IoT system consisted of three different applications for streaming sensor data.
- [Sensor Aggregation](https://github.com/ifindev/sensor-aggregation): REST API endpoints for aggregating sensor data by room area and by date-time built using express.js for an the backend of an IoT system. 
- [Salary conversion endpoint](https://github.com/ifindev/salary-conversion-endpoint). This is a minimalist REST API endpoint created using Express JS for fetching user data and converting salary from IDR to USD using curreny rate fetched from external API. 
- [A minimalist To-Do list](https://github.com/ifindev/todo-list) live on **([netlify](https://ifindev-todo.netlify.app/))**. Stack: React JS, Local Storage, Netlify.
- [Javascript Number Guesser](https://github.com/ifindev/guess-number) for DOM manipulation practice. Live on **[netlify](https://guessing-game-js.netlify.app)**. Stack: HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla Javascript. 
- [Loopstudios](https://github.com/ifindev/loopstudios) landing page live on **[netlify](https://loopstudios-web.netlify.app/)**.
